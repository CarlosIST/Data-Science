        "A new study says that if you drink more than four cups a day, it might -- it might -- increase the risk of an early death. >> At this coffee shop in Atlanta today, excitement is brewing over new research showing that morning cup of Joe may help you live longer. Just one cup a day lowered the chance by 12%. Bump that to three cups a day and the risk drops by 18%. >> So if you're drinking coffee right now, you're probably wondering which study to believe.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, today I'm going to show you how to judge the true strength of the evidence so that you can make sense of conflicting data. The key is to recognize when the evidence is exaggerated. Well, to start with, a scientific study is always more persuasive when the results are replicated or confirmed in a second independent study. A bullseye on the first shot might be lucky, but two in a row is probably not a random accident. Unfortunately, the two coffee studies totally contradict one another. \n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, there are so many examples of contradictory studies that one prominent scientist suggested that most published research could be false. For example, the FDA took a look at 22 cases where the results of phase 3 contradicted the results of phase 3. Some scientists even think we might have a replication crisis. \n",
        "\n",
        "Well, the main character in this controversy is the gatekeeper of P-values called statistical significance. A p-value is a value between 0 and 1 that tells you how surprising the data is if there's no effect other than random variation. Now, smaller p-values represent stronger evidence of a real effect. Let's look at an example from one of the early cholesterol drugs. Pravastatin reduces the risk of coronary events by 31% in patients with high cholesterol who've never had a heart attack. The p-value for Pravastatin is less than .001. This means that we would expect to see a 31% reduction in coronary events purely by chance, less than one in a thousand times. \n",
        "\n",
        "So this data's too surprising to be random luck. And it's evidence of a real drug effect. Now, the key point is that smaller p-values represent stronger evidence of a real drug effect. Now, this begs the question, when are p-values small enough to represent statistically significant evidence? Well, the traditional threshold for statistical significance is .05 or one in 20. Now, p-values less than .05 represent drug effects that are large enough to be surprising and -- and worth a little bit more research, because we would expect that purely by chance less than 20 times. It's enough proof for publication. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, in the p-values above .05, that represents drug effects that are more likely to be random noise, and usually they wind up unpublished in the researcher's trash can. Now, some scientists believe the .05 threshold allows too many false discoveries to slip into the published literature. This sparked a debate on whether to ban p-values in statistical significance altogether. But p-values are not to blame. The replication crisis is a result of unrealistic expectations that grow out of exaggerated evidence. Here's the simplest guide I can give you for setting realistic expectations based on the evidence. \n",
        "\n",
        "P-values less than .05 or one in 20 are evidence of something surprising and they invite a second study. P-values less than one in a hundred represent strong evidence. And p-values less than one in a thousand represent proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and they probably don't need independent confirmation. This is why some drugs are approved just based on a single study. Now, let's look a little deeper at what to expect when the strength of evidence is right around .05 or one in 20 where replication is not as certain. Suppose we test a thousand drugs in independent clinical trials. \n",
        "\n",
        "The 10 blocks of a hundred little pills. Assume 10% are effective, the hundred in the white block, and assume 90% are ineffective, the 900 in the red blocks. Now, our gatekeeper correctly identifies most of the effective drugs for publication, but he sends a few effective drugs into the trash can by mistake. He filters out almost all of the ineffective drugs into the trash can, as he should, and only 5% of the ineffective drugs slip by him and are mistakenly published as meaningful discoveries. Now, bear in mind many of these false discoveries get cleaned up over time as we conduct more studies. \n",
        "\n",
        "So statistical significance is not a guarantee of replication, but it helps us to identify most of the good drugs without becoming overwhelmed by too many false discoveries. Unfortunately, there are two silent killers of replication that exaggerate the evidence, and they trick the gatekeeper into allowing false discoveries to slip through. And these are multiplicity and selection bias. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start with multiplicity. We ask almost unlimited questions of the data from a single clinical trial. The number of end points, doses, subgroups and other factors quickly multiply. It's like bunny rabbits, into 20, 30, 40, 50, even hundreds of p-values. For example, in this list of 40 p-values, we naturally focus on the smallest ones like the one in red. It looks really impressive, but the true strength of evidence depends on the number of questions that we asked. When you take into account the 40 questions, the strength of evidence is no longer proof beyond doubt. \n",
        "\n",
        "It's simply something surprising and worth another look. Now, without the context of the number of questions, p-values can exaggerate the evidence and really look stronger than they really are. Now, selection bias is the other silent killer of replication, and it really hurts the gatekeeper. When we ask multiple questions, we have a tendency to switch our focus after we see the data to the best outcomes. It's like shooting first and then painting a bullseye around the hole like that was our target all along. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's look at an example from a drug for high blood pressure. PRAISE-1 and PRAISE-2 were clinical trials evaluating amlodopine in heart patients. It had a promising effect in mortality in one subgroup of patients. You might expect replication based on the p-value in red which is less than one in a thousand. But the PRAISE-2 model did not replicate the mortality findings observed in the PRAISE-1 trial. Why not? What happened? Investigators switched end points and then focused on the best of eight subgroups in a clinical trial with no overall effect. So that p-value in red exaggerated the evidence and probably didn't support conducting a second trial."

        "In summation, the frequentist approach to A/B testing is used to make a decision based on statistical significance of the outcome favouring one of the two variants A or B. This is done through identifying the null and alternative hypothesis associated to the test, identifying the sample size and calculating the test statistic at a certain confidence interval. Once the test statistic is obtained we can determine the P value and conclude if we accept or reject the null hypothesis."
